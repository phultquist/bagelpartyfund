# Bagel Party Fund
Every couple of months, bagel party is hosted at IMSA, where, through many donations, students are provided with bagels, and, yes a party.

Bagel Party 10, originally scheduled to be May 12, was cancelled due to COVID, but we raised money for the black lives matter movement, thus this page is a tracker.
